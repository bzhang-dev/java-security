# Password Generator 
Edited by Boyuan Zhang

SecureRandom class in Java provides a cryptographically secure pseudo ï¿½ random number generator and its intended use is for security sensitive applications. In this example, we will not use it for its intended purpose, but rather present its methods in a simple password generator.

A convention, we made for our password generator is that the final password can consist of capital letters A-Z, lower-case a-z, numbers 0-9 and the symbols #, $, %, & and @.
